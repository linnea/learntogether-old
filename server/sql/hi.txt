i'm thinking db scripts will go in here?
like:
- initial create
- v0.1 update
- v0.2 update
... etc

likelike
- 0.0.0.sql
- 0.0.1.sql
- 0.0.2.sql
- 0.1.2.sql
- 0.1.11.sql

and the system runs them in order to make sure things are kosher?
or we run them by hand? or however we decide to manage schema version
