- should we put lib in public instead of private?
	1. they're all publicly available (free third party components)
	2. won't need an auth check on every request

- should we "auth" namespace
	- "auth" routes
		- domain.com/auth/login,signup,logout,profile
	- "auth" controller
		- auth.webRequiresLogin
		- auth.apiRequiresLogin

	"auth" controller things are MIDDLEWARE
	most API things will be ENDPOINTS

	should those be separated?

	MEAN.JS merges both in "controllers"
	generator-angular-fullstack uses component-style folders with rails-style endpoints
